; Output Messages

; This file contains only a .data section in which we define all the messages we are using throughout the
    ; program. This let's us easily change messages as needed and would allow for an easier translation
    ; process for example. We'll just need to include the file wherever its messages are needed and,
    ; as we are including it more than once we actually need to define a macro to stop the strings defined
    ; in it from being redefined with the second include. That's why we check to see if the OUT_MSGS macro
    ; is defined. As the first time this file is to be included it WON'T be defined it'll be treated normally
    ; and the macro will be defined BUT the second time it's included in another place the OUT_MSGS macro will
    ; already be defined which will cause this file not to be including, thus avoiding rewriting all the strings
    ; we have already defined. Nonetheless, including it in a second file will let subroutines in it find the
    ; pertinent addresses. All in all, we can find the strings from anywhere we include the file BUT we only feed
    ; them once to nasm so that there are no redefinition errors. This technique has been found on section 4.6.1 of
    ; the NASM Documentation. Please note that we need to end the %ifndef clause with an %endif directive at the end.
    ; We'll refer to this comment from other files so that we don't add redundant information to the codebase.

; Note many of the messages include a newline character ('\n' == 0xA == 10) so that we avoid having to call the I/O
    ; function print_nl_new after every call to print_string_new, therefor reducing the code size.
