# Analyzing hardcoded passwords
As both of our implementations contain the password strings as normal variables we'll see they actually show up by running `strings` on the executables as well as if we analyze them with disassemblers such as `radare2`. Just bear in mind that for `strings` to pick these passwords up we need to make them longer than `3` characters as that `strings` limit for considering a string as something valuable and not rubbish! If we make our password `foo` it won't show up but if it's `fooo` it'll!

We should also point out you can doctor the password by using a hex editor such as [*Hex Fiend*](http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/) for macOS or *Bless Hex Editor`* for Linux. You just need to open the binary and look for the password string to then alter it to whatever you want. You can then rerun the program after saving the changes to find that the new password is effectively working and the old one is useless!
