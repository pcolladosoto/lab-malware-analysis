- [Absolute vs. Relative Addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addressing_mode#Simple_addressing_modes_for_code)
    + The `rel` keyword in `nasm` assembly, as seen in section `3.3` of its manual tells that effective addresses loaded with `lea` should be relative to the `RIP` (the program counter) instead of absolute which is the default behaviour.
- [Position Independent Code/Executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_independent_code)
    + This explains why we pass the `-no-pie` flag to `gcc` as we have hardcoded addresses!

## TODO
- [ ] Try not depending on your own executable for clearing the screen. Investigate how you can pass `argv` to `execve` either through the stack or through the registers.
